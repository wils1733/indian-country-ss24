37.3875,-122.0575,<h3>Indigenous Representation In Video Games</h3>,<h4>Silicon Valley</h4>,"Indigenous representation in the media has proven to be both beneficial and detrimental to Indigenous communities. Historically, news media had a tendency to label Indigenous individuals as (noble) savages, although slightly outdated. Despite this, it is through the same news media that Indigenous communities can bring attention to their concerns, reaching a vast audience. In the realm of movies and television, Indigenous communities were frequently cast as antagonists in western films. However, contemporary portrayals are evolving, depicting many Indigenous characters in a more positive light, even though at times it may be relying on stereotypes. Notably, there is a rise in shows such as “Reservation Dogs,” which spotlight Indigenous communities and their challenges. Yet, the question arises: how do video games, the newest addition in the media landscape, contribute to Indigenous representation?",<a href='sites/indigenous-representation/indigenous-representation.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

26.203407,-98.230011,<h3>Native acknowledgement (or lack thereof) on the U.S.-Mexico border</h3>,"<h4>The Lipan Apache tribe, mainly.</h4>","This project analyzes the differences between the United States, and Mexico when it comes to acknowledgement and indigenous identity. It's become an issue, especially in the border regions that so often, the United States comes to acknowledge tribes in the area, but Mexico does not. The issue within the lack of acknowledgement is the amount of people in Mexico with indigenous DNA, mostly in the border regions are where these identity problems happen. Throughout this project, Angelo Grose and Jayden Hewitt will examine legal documents that go over the acknowledgements, and the lack of documentation on the Mexican side. We will also be looking into how Indigenous peoples, especially the Lipan Apache peoples feel about their identity depending on where they fall between the United States, and Mexico.",<a href='sites/jayden-angelo-indian-country/AA-template.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

46.93926909,-113.9720132,<h3>Two-Spirits: Oppression and Resistance</h3>,<h4>Two-Spirits American Indigenous People</h4>,"Colonial views of gender and sexuality have historically been incredibly strict. So, colonists reacted horribly when they came into contact with Native people who took on gender roles outside of the binary. This project seeks to understand how those attitudes affect two-spirits in North America and how they have resisted oppression. As the history of gender diversity in North America becomes hidden, two-spirits find themselves ostracized from white communities because they are Indigenous, but also from Indigenous communities because they are two-spirit. Additionally, this page outlines several organizations for two-spirits in North America.",<a href='sites/sasha-busra-ss24/sasha-busra-ss24.html</a>
39.37625427,-83.00445588,<h3>Advocating for Access to Sacred Earthworks</h3>,,"Human-built earthworks -like those that comprise the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks complex in present-day Ohio- are sacred and culturally crucial sites that hold great importance for Native American individuals and groups, many of whom are hindered or blocked from utilizing them in the proper manners they are intended for. Due to a variety of political, economic, and social factors, many of these sites have been irreparably damaged or destroyed during periods of “exploration” and “development,” or are currently considered the legal property of the landowners whose property bounds them. This project will be using a perspective associated with the recent societal embrace of ideas like cultural ownership and repatriation that now hold museums and similar institutions accountable for upholding their responsibilities to support the ethical gathering and sharing of cultural knowledge. The ultimate goal is to argue and exemplify that the reasoning and beliefs backing the return of funerary and other sacred items to Indigenous nations can -and should- also be applied to the idea of unhindered and easy access to religious and culturally crucial sites.",<a href='sites/advocating-for-access-to-sacred-earthworks/advocating-for-access-to-sacred-earthworks.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

Citizenship affects sovereignty, sovereignty affects identity, and identity affects the community. Due to the borders put in their way, the Kickapoo nation is vulnerable to decisions made by countries such as Mexico and the US. With this vulnerability towards external forces these groups are left reliant upon the actions of foreign powers. Access to adequate healthcare, land territories, and twin tribes are all dependent on the country where they reside. With a nation divided by foreign borders there is a discrepancy in citizenship, but also a split between several parts of what is meant to be a whole nation.

        <h4>I. Introduction</h4>
          

          <!-- Check your handouts and the wiki (https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country/wiki) for specific help on how to work with figures/images-->
          <p><i>Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals. Indigenous individuals also have the right to access, without any discrimination, to all social and health services.</i> (<a href="https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>, 2007, Article 24, Section 1)</p>
          <p>Understanding the historical and contemporary health issues facing the Native American community is crucial for several reasons. First, it provides context for current health disparities and systemic challenges faced by these communities. The Mandan tribe, for example, was severely impacted by a smallpox epidemic in 1837, which not only drastically reduced their population but also had long-lasting effects on their culture and society. This historical event mirrors the health crises many Indigenous communities still face today, highlighting the continued vulnerability of these populations to health issues. Understanding these historical health crises helps illuminate the roots of mistrust towards the healthcare system in these communities, which can inform efforts to improve healthcare access and outcomes. A deeper understanding of these matters can contribute to more culturally sensitive healthcare provision, which respects and acknowledges traditional Indigenous health practices and beliefs. </p>

          <p>The traditional territory of the Mandan, as historian Elizabeth Fern affectionately dubs The Heart of the World, was near the geographical center of the North American continent, where the Heart River joins the Missouri. Their culture was rich, with distinct traditions such as dome-shaped lodges, a tripartite leadership system, and a variety of agricultural and hunting practices. However, their prosperity was disrupted in the 17th Century when European settlers introduced smallpox, a highly contagious, deadly disease.  </p>
          <p>There is very little information when it comes to the devastating smallpox epidemic that resulted in the near extinction of the Mandan community, most of the information is preserved in the journals of trappers, explorers, and in family legends. What we do know is that the Mandan was largely vulnerable to the diseases brought by Europeans, and in the winter of 1837 the epidemic resulted in the loss of 98% of the Mandan and two-thirds of the neighboring Hidatsa population. (reinhiller). </p>
          <p>As a result, the Mandan, Hidasta, and Arikara began to consolidate their communities, with whom they intermarried. While many children were left orphaned, members of their families' clans adopted them. Some survivors proceeded to settle near Fort Berthold in 1845, and in 1850 there were 385 Mandan, largely of mixed blood, living. (mha nation)</p>

            <h4>III. Modernity</h4>
          <p>As of February 1, 2024, there are currently 17,389 enrolled members of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation. There are only a few of the full-blooded Mandan left. The culture has changed, the language has changed, and as a nation the Mandan are practically extinct (mhanation). </p>
          <p>Currently the Indian Health services operates an ambulatory health center facility on the Fort Berthold reservation. The main health center, Minnie-Tohe, is located at Four bears. Lake Sakakawa physically separates all facilities from each other. Emergent health issues, access to more immediate critical health care, has again brought to the forefront the need for building a reservation based hospital.

          <p>Approximately 95% of Indigenous populations in the Americas, equivalent to an estimated 20 million people, were wiped out by infectious diseases in the aftermath of European colonization (Ehrenpreis). Numerous conspiracy theories emerged following the 1837 epidemic, suggesting that smallpox was intentionally spread among Native Americans via contaminated blankets (reinhiller). This was allegedly done to reduce their populations, leading to the widespread remembrance of this case of biological warfare among Indigenous populations today (howard). </p>
          <p>The continued subjection of Indigenous communities to unethical research and forced enculturation has contributed to the medical distrust within the Native American community. This includes the repercussions of the 1819 Indian Civilization Act Fund, which forcibly removed Native American children from their homes and placed them in boarding schools. These children were subjected to medical experimentation and forced sterilization, practices that continued until the 1970s. (Ehrenpreis)</p>

          <h4>V. Native American Healthcare and Concerns</h4>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected the Native American community, highlighting the deep-rooted health disparities that exist due to systemic inequalities. Native American populations have faced higher infection and mortality rates compared to other races, largely due to pre-existing conditions, limited healthcare access, and socio-economic factors. (Ehrenpreis)</p>
        <p>Many Native American communities often have higher rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Limited access to quality healthcare, coupled with a lack of resources within tribal health systems, further heightens this risk. (Ehrenpreis)</p>
        <p>The pandemic has also strained the already limited healthcare resources in these communities. These challenges have highlighted the need for more substantial support and resources to ensure the health and well-being of the Native American community during the pandemic and beyond.</p>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <h4>VI. Conclusion</h4>
          <p>The Native American community has faced significant health challenges historically and in the present day, rooted in systemic inequalities. The near-extinction of the Mandan tribe due to a smallpox epidemic introduced by European settlers is a key example of these health crises. This incident, combined with unethical research practices, forced assimilation, and relocation, has contributed to mistrust of the healthcare system within the Native American community. Today, this community faces disproportionate effects from the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited healthcare access, socio-economic, and environmental factors. Addressing these disparities is crucial to ensuring the health and well-being of the Native American community.</p>
        <p>Efforts are in progress to improve the relationship between the medical community and underserved communities. Priorities include the integration of traditional medicinal practices, creating culturally sensitive clinical environments, and hiring healthcare professionals from the very communities they serve. The aim is to enhance healthcare practices through community involvement. (ep)</p>

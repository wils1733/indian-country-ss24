          <p style="font-family:EB garamound"><big>Human-built mounds and other earthworks - like those that comprise the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks complex in present-day central Ohio - are sacred and culturally crucial sites that hold great importance for Native American individuals and groups, many of whom are limited or blocked from using and enjoying the sites in the ways they are intended to be used. Due to various political, economic, and social factors, many of these earthworks have been irreparably damaged or destroyed during periods of “exploration” and “development,” or are now considered the legal possessions and responsibility of the landowners whose property lines contain the sites. This project will use a perspective that relies on the recent widespread embrace of ideas like cultural ownership and object repatriation that now hold museums and similar institutions accountable for supporting and upholding the ethical gathering and sharing of knowledge. This viewpoint will be used to argue that the reasoning and beliefs backing the return of funerary and other sacred items to Indigenous nations can - and should - also be applied to the idea of unhindered and easy access to religious and culturally crucial sites.</big>

          <hr>
          <p style="font-family:EB garamound"><big>Human-built earthworks associated with burial and other ceremonial contexts that were constructed by various Indigenous groups during a 5,000 year period extending from around 3500 B.C.E. to 1500 C.E. were once numerous across what is now the Eastern United States. While there are now only a fraction remaining compared to what once existed, these sites endure (albeit in various degrees of care) as visually poignant reminders of the past as well as crucial foundational aspects that help anchor Indigenous groups and cultures within contemporary American society. Given their breadth of importance, the preservation of Native American earthworks as well as ease of access to these sites for Indigenous individuals and groups is imperative. By considering examples where locales that hold significance for Native North Americans have been successfully protected and stewarded in a manner that promotes Indigenous groups using them in ways that are considerate and culturally appropriate, the feasibility of securing widespread access and availability to these sites is evident.</big></p>

          <hr>
          <p style="font-family:EB garamound"> <big>Although U.S. legal systems and governance have a questionable, tense history regarding the recognition and protection of Indigenous culture, recent events suggest that the courtroom may now be one of the most efficient and successful settings in which Indigenous people can advocate for their rights and achieve the desired outcome, although this development retains its own issues. In 2022, the Ohio History Connection was successful in its years-long legal bid to take over the state’s lease with a Newark country club that ran a golf course located over the Octagon Earthworks complex that the historical society wished to reclaim control over <a href="https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/53992/PDF/1/play/" rel="citation" data-content="Court sides with history society’s access to earthworks - ICT News

">[Welsh-Huggins & Smyth]</a>. However, the process was complex and lengthy, with the OHC first having to prove to the state Supreme Court that they had followed all of the legal requirements and expectations involved with a letting contract in Ohio. They also had to prove that the Moundbuilders Country Club had not fulfilled the public accessibility terms of their 2003 agreement to justify and win their claim. It is evident that these attractive endings only occur when the law is already leaning in Indigenous groups’ favor as it was written and when all involved parties meet the requirements that the United States and its entities set forth. There is not such an appealing conclusion to these proceedings when Indigenous existence contradicts or doesn’t conform to the expectations of U.S. culture and history.</big></p>

          <p style="font-family: EB garamound"><big>Outcomes that benefit Indigenous nations’ access to historical and cultural sites are also highly uncommon when the sites in question are located on privately-owned property or in locations deemed desirable for development by authority entities. While most of the mounds and other earthworks that were built by Indigenous North Americans were destroyed or leveled during periods of colonial and national expansion in the early centuries of the U.S.’s existence - an estimated 90% of these sites were lost forever by 1948 <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Roger G. Kennedy, Hidden cities: the discovery and loss of ancient North American civilization. (New York: Free Press, 1994), 239">(Kennedy)</a> - there are some that survive, although many of these are now legally considered the property of the owners of the land they lie on. More often than not, these owners have been non-Indigenous individuals, governmental coalitions, or corporate entities who disregard the importance and sacredness of these sites and who hide, exploit, deface, or destroy them in pursuit of their individual interests. Historically, these actions were linked to motivations like colonialist expansion, economic growth, and perceived racial superiority while contemporary opposition typically leans to less hostile motivations like retaining control over familial properties and believing the sites are U.S./state history while disregarding their significance as Indigenous history. This blatant ignoring and dismissal of the importance of cultural cornerstones leads to difficulties or impossibilities in access to important sites and, later, to immense spiritual consequences for the Indigenous groups who are most affected. The inability to access and use their ancestral lands in the ways they were intended to be used often directly opposes core principles within Indigenous ideologies and lifeways, exacerbating existing issues of cultural displacement and the widespread struggle to thrive as a distinct but accepted group. This common sentiment is supported by the writing of Kiowa author N. Scott Momaday, who mused that “At Devil’s Tower or Canyon de Chelly or the Cahokia Mounds, you touch the pulse of the living planet; you feel its breath upon you. You become one with a spirit that pervades geologic time and space"<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="N. Scott Momaday, The Man Made of Words: Essays, Stories, Passages. (Basingstoke, UK: Macmillan, 1998), 114.
">(Momaday)</a>. The inability to experience such powerful and culturally crucial feelings like this in the locations that have long been designated for such events is detrimental to the long-term success and continued existence of these marginalized groups. It is unlikely that U.S. laws will ever change in ways that require owners of private land to allow access to or relinquish control over their property. However, shifts in societal attitudes are powerful catalysts for action and can perhaps make these individuals more receptive to the idea of choosing to share or transfer stewardship of such crucial sites as burial and ceremonial earthworks to the relevant groups. </big></p>

	          <h3 style="font-family: Gill Sans"><b>Possible Community-Based Solutions</b></h3>
        <hr>
          <p style="font-family: EB garamound"><big>Another growing way in which the active involvement of the U.S. government and other outside organizations can contribute positively and effectively to this cause is through supportive partnerships. While sometimes unpopular with Indigenous individuals because it relinquishes much of the stewardship of these sites to non-Indigenous groups, the utilization of designations like National/State Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site provided by governmental and international authorities is often highly effective in quickly preserving these areas from threats. These relationships provide levels of protection and available resources to important sites that sometimes can not be matched through other channels. This choice has become increasingly common in recent years, as is evidenced by the popularity of the “Tribal Homelands Initiative” jointly undertaken by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture in 2021 that prioritizes the inclusion of Native Americans in the decision-making process for the stewardship of federal land and waters. The ongoing combined efforts of the Muscogee Nation and governmental entities from Georgia in pursuit of gaining National Park status for the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park in Macon, Georgia are another example of utilizing these available partnerships to increase the availability and ease of access to these culturally crucial sites while also aiming to make history and create new precedents as the first U.S. National Park to be co-managed in full by a removed Indigenous nation. [Warren] Other past examples of beneficial outcomes stemming from tentative partnerships between tribal nations and the National Park Service include the periodic closing of rock climbing at Devil’s Tower National Park to accommodate the seasonal ceremonies observed by local Indigenous nations [Cross & Brenneman], co-management of a portion of Badlands National Park with the Lakota Sioux [Wilkinson], and the Timbisha Indians being left free to reside in a portion of Death Valley National Park (albeit very small and assigned involuntarily).

            <p style="font-family:EB garamound"><big>While efforts are still ongoing in Macon as of writing, the teamwork between the Ohio History Connection and multiple Indigenous groups including the American National Congress of American Indians, the Inter-Tribal Council which represents tribes that live in Northeast Oklahoma, and the Seneca Nation of New York State has already been successful in the pursuit of UNESCO World Heritage Site designation for the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks (a complex of eight related earthworks sites across southern Ohio described as “part cathedral, part cemetery and part astronomical observatory”) [Smyth]. This is another recent example of successful preservation and promotion of access to these ancient sites by using resources and opportunities stemming from non-Indigenous governments and organizations. Although this approach comes with the caveat of requiring Indigenous groups to share access and control over these sites, there are actions that can be taken to emphasize their sovereignty and authority within these initiatives. For example, the original plans to expand Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park into the Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve include a 130-acre area within the core of the proposed parklands that is owned by the tribal government based in Okmulgee, Oklahoma and intended to be reserved for the exclusive use of the Muscogee Nation, to ensure that they always have an area for themselves embedded within the core of their ancestral lands.

        <h3 style="font-family:Gill Sans"><b>Future Direction</b></h3>
        <hr>
          <p style="font-family:EB garamound"><big>The preservation of Native American earthworks and their greater representative role within their related Indigenous groups is imperative for multiple reasons that have been explained here. However, one of the most primary and consequential reasons is that these sites can provide archaeological evidence that is crucial for meeting the prerequisites for giving federal recognition and continued fulfillment of treaty agreements, as well as the protections and resources that accompany these conditions. [D’Innocenzo] Given the evidenced presence and success of widespread cultural attitudes and social conditions that recognize and regret the history of wrongs committed against Native Americans by authority and citizen groups, current and future leaders in the U.S. can find ease of success in their efforts to create a more altruistic society that fully considers and includes Indigenous nations and lifeways.

        <h1>Indigenous Representation In Videogames</h1>
            <h4><em>Alexander Sessions and DJ Kaur</em></h4>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
		    <hr> 
          <p>Indigenous representation in the media has proven to be both beneficial and detrimental to Indigenous communities. Historically, news media had a tendency to label Indigenous individuals as (noble) savages. Despite this, it is through the same news media that Indigenous communities can bring attention to their concerns, reaching a vast audience. In the realm of movies and television, Indigenous communities were frequently cast as antagonists in western films. However, contemporary portrayals are evolving, depicting many Indigenous characters in a more positive light, even though at times it may be relying on stereotypes. Yet, the question arises: how do video games, the newest addition in the media landscape, contribute to Indigenous representation, and through what other ways does it contribute to preservation? </p>
          <p>By looking at how Indigenous peoples are shown in individual mainstream games, you can chart a course in seeing how views have changed over the years, going from showing them as savage enemies to depicting them as actual living communities and people. You can also see how Indigenous developers have decided to use video games as a medium through which to tell stories from their own perspective, as well as a way of cultural preservation.</p>
          <br>

	          <h3>The Mainstream Transition: Red Dead Redemption</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Like other forms of media, video games made a transition from relying on stereotypes and prejudices in their depictions to instead show a far more human and realistic, if not entirely accurate, depiction of what (or rather who) Indigenous people are at their core. While this was a gradual trend that spanned multiple years and games, you can actually see the transition within two games of the same series: <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> (RD1), made in 2010,  and it’s sequal <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (RD2), which was made in 2018. In both games the player character is a white cowboy/frontiersman who’s had troubles with the law (John Marston in RD1 and Arthur Morgan in RD2), and in both games there is a single community of Indigenous people who interact with the player. </p>

            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/e/ed/RainsFall.png/revision/latest?cb=20181115053207" width="100%">

            </figure>
            
            <p> The similarities end there, however, as in RD1, the Indigenous community is a violent  <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Dutch%27s_Gang">gang</a> made up of young men from various tribes that actively harasses the player and nearby communities. This gang is shown to wear feathers and war paint, and are eventually crushed by a player-aided US government raid, serving only as a group that the player must destroy. RD2, however, takes a very different approach, as the Indigenous <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Wapiti_Indians">Wapiti tribe</a> is depicted more sympathetically as refugees; victims of constant displacement by the US government. In RD2, the player actually assists the Wapiti in attempting to avoid removal, including stealing papers from an oil company trying to take Wapiti land, launching an attack on said company’s building, and stealing vaccines that were being held back by government representatives. These attempts result in eventual failure, but the tribe manages to survive by moving to Canada.</p>

            <p>In just the span of 8 years and two games, there is a clear transition between video games depicting Indigenous peoples as adversarial and savage, to depicting them as people with complexity and agency outside of being a simple enemy that must be defeated or overcome in order to advance. </p>
  
        <h3>Means of Representation</h3>

            </figure>

          <p>It should come as no surprise that, as time went on and stories were being told, there would be video games made that sought to diversify the typically white-dominated cast of playable characters. Some of these characters might be a tad on-the-nose (especially in earlier games), as game franchises such as <em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> tend to rely on obvious and eye-cathcing stereotypes in order for players to immediately identify certain characters of certain ethnicities, with their respective Native characters Nightwolf and T. Hawk dressing in buckskin and denim, adorned with feathers and war paint. The characters for these types of games are often presented as a type of gimmick, as the premise for both games is based around fighters coming from far and wide, so while anything more than a surface-level show of representation would be appreciated, it is not to be expected.<p>

          
          <p>Other games such as <em>Infamous Second Son</em> however, rely less on stereotypes and gimmicks to depict Indigenous characters, instead taking players to the city of Seattle in the Northwest Coast and having them play as Delsin Rowe, a member of the fictional Akomish Tribe. As stated in an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/25/4702318/under-the-hood-of-infamous-second-son-hyper-real-seattle">interview</a> with game director Nate Fox, the decision to make Delsin of Indigenous descent was largely influenced by the chosen locale of the game, as the Northwest Coast is known for having a significant Indigenous population. In terms of design, if you saw someone like Delsin in the street, you could easily pass by without a second look as he dresses in a typical punk-style and speaks without an accent, completely at odds with the more flamboyant depictions of Indigenous characters who speak as though they were characters from a Clint Eastwood film. <p>

        <h3>Indigenous Developers</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>While most games featuring Indigenous cultures and characters are developed by non-Indigenous developers and companies, Indigenous developers do exist and they have led some very impressive projects utilizing video games and the technologies associated with them. A game that follows the typical video game format that focuses on entertainment is <em>Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna)</em>, which was developed in collaboration with the Iñupiat and their storytellers. <a href="http://neveralonegame.com/game/"><em>Never Alone</em></a> takes place in the Arctic and features Iñupiaq stories and figures, all narrated in the Iñupiaq language, serving as a method of not only sharing Iñupiaq culture with others, but also serves as a method of cultural preservation and education for new generations.</p>    
          <p>Video games typically act as a form of entertainment, however, video games can also serve as a tool of cultural preservation, as the <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/torres-strait-virtual-reality-virtual-reality">Torres Strait Virtual Reality</a> (TSVR) is a game that uses Virtual Reality (VR) technology to provide an interactive and immersive way to experience cultural events such as the Tombstone Opening, which in the game requires the player to search and acquire the needed materials all while providing an environment loyal to their real-life counterparts. Not to mention games such as the ones found on websites such as Newgrounds and Cool Math Games, which are full of homemade, single developer games with very simple controls and, in the case of Cool Math Games, are made with the intention to educate young learners.</p> 
        <br>  
          
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <hr>
            <p>Although Indigenous representation and involvement in video games and their development was largely limited to stereotypical depictions and roles, great strides have been made to provide players with a richer gaming experience all while giving Indigenous communities another means through which to express themselves and their culture to the wider world and to their own up-and-coming generations. While the landscape of gaming will likely continue to be dominated by white developers and colonialistic worldviews, things have improved and the current gaming ecosystem has never been so diverse and welcoming to Indigenous developers and their audiences. </p>

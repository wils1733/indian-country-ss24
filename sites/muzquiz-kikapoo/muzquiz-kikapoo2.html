          <p>In the United States, the majority of conversations concerning Indigenous nations focus on those living within U.S. borders. 
            However, as colonization pushed westward, the displacement of Indigenous Nations, through events such as the Trail of Tears and disrespected treaties, separated Nations from their point of origin. 
            The Kickapoo (Kikapú in the Spanish spelling) were subject to this intense displacement as their roots planted around the Great Lakes were pulled and forced south just past the Mexican border. 
            Different factions of the Kickapoo stayed in the United states due to treaties made with the US government while others went to Mexico in search of land and opportunities. </p>

            <p>The Kickapoo have their origins in the Great Lake region of lower Michigan. 
              They are considered to be a part of the Algonquian linguistic lineage whose territory originally bordered on east and north by the great lakes and on the west by the Mississippi River. 
              At the beginning of colonization they had complicated relations with the French which set the stage for duplicity on the side of the young United States. 
              The broken promises made by several nations led to the major displacement of the Kickapoo from what is now Michigan to an area close to Muzquiz, Coahuila Mexico. 
              As a result of this intense displacement the Kickapoo have been subject to conflict with sovereignty, healthcare, and legal recognition by the Mexican and US government. 

              These difficulties affect not only the Kickapoo but all indigenous people separated by these new foreign borders. <a href="#jump">(“History of the Mexican Kickapoo”, Milwaukee Public Museum)</a>. <!-- This is how you will create a pop-over link for intext citations--> </p>

    <h3><strong>Land Sovereignty</strong></h3>

    <hr>
    <p>For Indigenous communities the topic of ‘Sovereignty’ is one of continuously heated debate.
    There is a solid claim to be made on the lands Native Americans had occupied since long before the colonization of the Americas began. When these communities have a verified connection for the land they fight to maintain, there is a stronger sense of sovereignty
    over that land, both recognized by the tribe and the foreign powers surrounding it. It is this fight for sovereignty and recognition of said sovereignty that is seen throughout the United States. But what can be said for tribes who populate land of which they had
    no ancestral claim to? For transnational tribes, such as the Muzquiz-Kickapoo, there can be a more complicated connection to the land and the nation they live on. </p>
    
    <p>The journey from the Great Lakes of Michigan to Muzquiz Coahuila Mexico is long in both distance
    and duration. Via European records, observation of Kickapoo habitation of the Great Lakes is dated as early as the 1600’s <a href="#jump">(Schulze, Jefferey M.)</a>. Combining the fact that the Kickapoo gained Mexican land plots in the 1840’s, you are left with nearly 250 years of migration.
    The first trek was to Wisconsin in 1654 due to hostility between neighboring tribes <a href="#jump">(Schulze, Jefferey M.)</a>, and later to Illinois <a href="#jump">(Goggin, John M. 1951)</a>. It is around the 1800’s when the formation, as well as terminations, of treaties were commonplace. It was the creation and alterations
    of certain treaties that led to the movement to Missouri in 1819, and Kansas in 1932. Lower and lower the Kickapoo were slowly getting pushed until they eventually made their way to texas, which was at the time the Mexican Province of Texas.</p>

            </figure>
    <p>Circling back to the question
    of sovereignty, why were the Kickapoo given land from a nation of which they had no ancestral roots? It isn’t so much a question of whether or not the Kickapoo hold a claim over Mexican land, but rather what is there to gain (by both parties) from a partnership between the Kickapoo
    and the Mexican government. It was this cost and gain mentality that led the Mexican government to offer land in Texas in exchange for defending the borders from hostile tribes <a href="#jump">(Goggin, John M. 1951)</a>. This relationship prospered until 1838, when Texas was eventually annexed into a U.S.
    state, and the Kickapoo went from being Mexico inhabitants to America inhabitants. It was due to this, as well as the newly placed 1839 Indian Removal Policy made by Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar, that the Kickapoo were forced to once again flee southward past the border.
    They were once again granted access to land in exchange for loyalty and border defense by the Mexican government in 1848.</p>
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <h3><strong>National Citizenship</strong></h3>
    <hr> <!--This prints a line under the title-->
    <p> After the Kickapoo were divided into northern and southern branches separated by the Mexican border, there was a query as to what
       a member’s national citizenship was. Would all Kickapoo Indians be considered American natives due to their origins, or are the members
        found below the border Mexican natives due to their current occupancy? </p>

    <p>The laws pertaining to indigenous citizenship differ between countries, as well as what benefits are offered with citizenship compared
       to without. Any Kickapoo Indians who find themselves in Mexico, for example, would be granted rights equal to the average Mexican citizen.
        This mandate was the result of a 1950 land agreement from the Mexican government, a time of peak migration to Coahuila, Mexico. And by the
         late 1900’s, all Mexican Kickapoo were guaranteed rights of passage by the Mexican government <a href="#jump">(Luna-Firebaugh, Eileen M. 2002.)</a>..</p>
    <p>Laws were more on the stern side when it came to the United States Government however. In accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952,
       the INS (The Immigration and Naturalization Service) designated all tribal members with parole status <a href="#jump">(Luna-Firebaugh, Eileen M. 2002.)</a>.. This status provided members
        with tribal identification cards that authorized unrestricted border crossing privileges. There are limitations to said privileges though; In order
         to be given a <strong>permanent</strong> border crossing card you need to acquire U.S. citizenship. This is not an isolated case. There are many
          related examples of incentivization via U.S. citizenship, and the loss of opportunities without. The Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Kickapoo casino in Texas is a perfect example 
          of this. In order to have property on U.S. federal land you have to be A)a federally recognized tribe and B)have U.S. citizenship. The absence of
           either one or both of these can result in a significant economic loss for themselves, the tribe, and their young generations <a href = "#jump">(Mager Hois, 2009)</a>.</p>

    <h3><strong>Identity</strong></h3>

    <hr> <!--This prints a line under the title-->
    <p> Being a transnational indigenous nation can lead to internal conflict regarding one’s cultural identity. 
      The dynamic nature of culture leaves it vulnerable to outside influences especially when the people are made to assimilate and adapt
      to  cultures in order to prosper socially and economically. 
      The more a culture changes the more they can take advantage of the adopted culture. The economic benefits that the 
      United States offers has led the Kickapoo to seek work there. 
      Since Mexico does not offer the same level of economic promise the Kickapoo are not as dependent on it leading to the certain individuals 
      integrating more US qualities than Mexican. <a href = "#jump">(Mager Hois, 2009)</a></p>
    <p> The dressing style and language patterns of the youth have adopted characteristics from the US. 
      Though it is seemingly a necessity, the trend among the younger generation of speaking English instead of Spanish or the traditional Kickapoo language has 
      raised concern among the elders about the future authenticity of Kickapoo culture. 
      This trend arises mainly due to able bodied workers living and working outside of El Nacimiento. 
      People often leave El Nacimiento with their families to work in seasonal agricultural jobs or move closer to the Kickapoo 
      Lucky Eagle Casino in Texas and are rarely in El Nacimiento. <a href = "#jump">(Mager Hois, 2009)</a> </p>
    <p>Having somewhere one can call home helps keep people grounded and gives them access to their community and culture. 
      With the drastic displacement the Kickapoo have faced the importance placed upon the site of El Nacimiento as 
      their main cultural center is imperative to passing the culture down through generations. 
      In an effort to connect with their culture, El Nacimiento is treated as a cultural retreat where people go to visit during weekends, 
      vacations, and religious celebrations. Most Elderly members of the Kickapoo prefer to stay in El Nacimiento and share their knowledge there. 
      This emphasis in practicing their traditions freely in El Nacimiento has helped preserve their 
      Cultural identity cannot stay static for long, the conscious effort people make to pass down the traditions is crucial to keeping the 
      culture alive and feeling connected to their roots. In El Nacimiento the Kickapoo are able to practice their ceremonies 
       and implement traditions into daily life passing on the knowledge onto future generations. <a href = "#jump">(Mager Hois, 2009)</a></p>
    <p>Below is a newsclip from Mexico that illustrates their life in EL Nacimiento.</p>

            <p>Translation of Video:</p>
          <p>Settled in Coahuila since almost two centuries ago, the Kickapoo indians who live in El Nacimiento (The Birthplace) in Múzquiz, Coahuila, are perhaps the best known of the three ethnic groups that exist in our entity who, despite modernity, maintain their customs. The Kickapoo are Indigenous people who originated from Southern Canada and Northern United States in the region of the Great Lakes and they lived in forests of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois in the first stage of the 19th Century and it was precisely the colonization that made them emigrate to Mexican lands in the government of President Benito Juarez. When celebrating the International Day of the Indigenous People a delegation of the Kickapoo Indians were in Saltillo and one of the leaders talked about their customs that they insist are rooted between them. 
          <i>“When we have kids we need to look for deer when we have kids and when someone passes we need the deer ribs for the final wake for the farewell. We are some 1500 strewn about everywhere. From here in El Nacimiento, and we are in Eagle Pass and in Oklahoma and in Kansas but originally all the ceremonies are in El Nacimiento and everyone. There are those that speak three languages: Kickapoo, our language, and Spanish and English. We have to learn these languages because we are living in Mexico and we need to practice speaking Spanish and when we go to the United States we have to know how to speak English”.</i> 
          A part of the compensation that the United State’s Government has given to the Kickapoo for taking their lands they have a casino in Eagle Pass that they manage and that gives them good earnings. With images of Marco Antonio Gámiz RCG News Carlos Castillo Borja.

    <h3><strong>Healthcare</strong></h3>
    <hr> <!--This prints a line under the title-->
    <p>Land sovereignty, citizenship, and identity all individually impact the Kickapoo people's life in many ways.
      Healthcare is an example of how the consolidation of all these aspects impact  Kickapoo daily life. The limitations in their land sovereignty cuts off the Kickapoo's access to traditional medicines. 
      This combined with the disparity between medical care offered in Mexico and the U.S. which often depends on a person's citizenship status can lead to questions about their identity.</p>
    <p> A lot of Indigenous groups have grown dependent on the little health assistance the governments provide, since they have been cut off from their traditional healthcare practices. The Kickapoo stand out in this sense because they wait much longer to seek help from any health physicians. Transportation and funds are big factors as to why the Kickapoo are hesitant to get medical assistance. When traveling, the laborers they travel with will rarely stop in order to get medical care for a Kickapoo individual. The Kickapoo are often responsible to pay for transportation on top of the exorbitant price of healthcare. Though English is becoming more prevalent in the Kickapoo community, many of recent Mexican origins will have difficulties with communicating in English, which is vital when getting a patient’s medical history. This can lead to misdiagnosis and could be detrimental to the patient. <a href="#jump">(De Montigny, Lionel Herman. 1966.)</a></p>
    <p> Though there are a small amount of medical facilities available to the Kickapoo in the United States, there are often limitations to a person receiving healthcare there. One limitation is need, which is often subjective and is measured with a diagnosis that can be difficult to obtain with a language barrier. Tribal membership and blood degree are often limitations as well since marriages between tribes can complicate what degree can actually be obtained, regardless of the person being incorporated into the religion. <a href="#jump">(De Montigny, Lionel Herman. 1966.)</a></p>
    <p> Income is a limitation for an unexpected reason. When a Kickapoo person is questioned about their ability to pay for the procedure in the U.S. they often go home since traditionally much of their income is shared which is a hard concept for others to understand. Traditional medicines in the Kickapoo culture are free so they have negative feelings towards western medicine. Within the Kickapoo community it is recognized that how much you pay determines the amount and care one gets when they visit the American doctor. The lengthy process and lack of resources leads to the Kickapoo arriving at healthcare centers very sick. The sicker an individual is, the more the procedures will cost, which turns into an endless cycle.<a href="#jump">(De Montigny, Lionel Herman. 1966.)</a></p>

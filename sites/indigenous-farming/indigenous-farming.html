        <h1>Indigenous Farming Practices</h1> 
          <h3>Broad Methods and Impacts</h3>
            <h4><em>Maddie Ramos and Eric Carey</em></h4>
        
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
		      <hr>
            <p>Though farming practices are not one-size-fits-all across every Indigenous community, Indigenous agriculture is often deeply intertwined with respect for the land one gathers resources from, connection to the food that is eaten, and overall sustainability.</p>
            <p>When discussing Indigenous farming practices, it is important to understand that Western agricultural systems are a product of colonialism. Graddy-Lovelace <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2016.1192133">(2017)</a> notes that capitalist racial hierarchies in US agricultural history have erased the systems of small-scale farmers, including Indigenous farmers. Graddy-Lovelace (2017) also notes that “concurrently, the lens of coloniality interrogates who controls and reproduces these agricultural narratives in US policy, who defines agricultural expertise, who determines a dominant agricultural agenda" -- the Western agricultural agenda is the one that is touted as "correct", placing emphasis on commodification of mass-produced foods, effectively disconnecting most people from what they eat and where it was grown. The mutual respect for our food and our Earth, as it is emphasized in many Indigenous food systems and lifeways, is lacking.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.indigenousfoodsystems.org/">The Indigenous Food Systems Network</a>, an organization headed in Vancouver, Canada (and the geographic point associated with this project), broadly seeks to redress some of these issues through mobilization and outreach within Indigenous communities. As their website notes, the Indigenous Food Systems Network "seeks to "apply culturally appropriate protocols and ancient ways of knowing through a consensus-based approach to critically analyzing issues, concerns and strategies as they relate to Indigenous food, land, culture, health, economics, and sustainability" (Indigenous Food Systems Network, n.d.).</p>

      <h3>Examples of Indigenous Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
        <hr>
          <h4>Zuni Runoff Agriculture</h4>
            <p>The Zuni in the southwest USA, as outlined by Sandor et al. (2002), have maintained runoff agricultural fields for generations – they are some of the oldest in the entire country. The Zuni have a system which identifies twelve major soil types, differentiated on the basis of color, texture, and consistency. As highlighted in the article, “these terms contain meaning beyond describing discrete material. They incorporate knowledge of soil material and agronomic properties, coupled with awareness of geomorphic and ecological processes that create and distribute earth materials". This knowledge, compounded and refined over many years, enables the Zuni to “recycle” precious agricultural resources in arid climates.</p>

          <h4>Sweetgrass Harvesting</h4>
             <figure style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px; float: right; width: 40%">
               <img src="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/images/20180729_BassHarborMarsh_Sweetgrass_7_96.jpg?maxwidth=1300&maxheight=1300&autorotate=false" width="100%">
               <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Wabanaki families harvest sweetgrass. Image by Yehyun Kim, c2018.">Image 1. Wabanaki families harvesting sweetgrass</a></figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>Another example of sustainable practices in Indigenous knowledge comes from Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass, which outlined a research project about Indigenous cultivation and harvesting of sweetgrass. It was found – to the shock of Western academics but not to the Potawotami Elders offering their guidance on the project – that sweetgrass has a special relationship to humans, relying on us for cultivation and thriving when harvested, whereas untouched or uncultivated sweetgrass dies. Sustainable harvesting practices have been a core tenet of Indigenous knowledge for millennia – as Kimmerer wrote, “If we use a plant respectfully it will stay with us and flourish. If we ignore it, it will go away” (Kimmerer, 2013). Even connection to sweetgrass, however, has been threatened; as highlighted by Schmitt <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/gathering-sweetgrass-and-renewing-the-past.htm">(2021)</a>, Wabanaki families in the Acadia region have historically been prohibited from harvesting sweetgrass in the boundaries of Acadia National Park - land that encompasses their traditional territory. This, again, highlights the colonially-enforced disconnect from agricultural products; that being said, recent legislation was passed allowing Wabanaki families to harvest sweetgrass within park lines, albeit subject to numerous restrictions. The park and the Wabanaki community have been working closesly in an attempt to best conserve the area, whilst also allowing the community to take what they need.</p>

          <h4>Three Sisters Planting</h4>
            <figure style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px; float: right; width: 40%">
               <img src="https://www.nps.gov/tont/learn/nature/images/milpa11.png" width="100%"> 
               <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Diagram of Three Sisters Planting. Image by Lopez-Ridaura, S., Barba-Escoto, L., Reyna-Ramirez, C.

              </figure>
            <p>Finally, one cannot speak about sustainable Indigenous agricultural practices without discussing the Three Sisters Planting methods, wherein squash, corn, and beans are grown together in the same plot of Earth. This method uses up less land for agriculture, promotes soil fertility, and fosters a connection between the food being grown and the person growing it.  An informational video on this specific method can be found below.</p>
            <br>
          <h4>Conclusions</h4>
            <p>Ultimately, these examples of Indigenous agricultural practices demonstrate both the rich scope of Indigenous ecological knowledge and their practical applications towards a more sustainable future. Implemenation of Indigenous sustainable agriculture has the potential to restore both relationships to land and connections to our food, both of which have been severed by coloniality. Revitalization of traditional agricultural practices - and by extension, self-determination over ideology surrounding them - is therefore an important aspect of Indigenous Food Sovereignty.</p>

      <h3>Food Sovereignty and Decolonization</h3>
        <hr>
         <p>Food sovereignty, as defined by Grey and Patel <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-014-9548-9">(2014)</a>, is “the peoples’, Countries’ or State Unions’ RIGHT to define their agricultural and food policy, without any dumping vis-à-vis third countries”. The term sovereignty includes many struggles caused by the transition to western agriculture and the challenges created. These challenges include:</p>
          <ul>- Prioritizing local agricultural production</ul>
          <ul>- Access of peasants and landless people to land, water, seeds, and credit</ul>
          <ul>- The right of farmers, peasants to produce food and the right of consumers to be able to decide what they consume, and how and by whom it is produced</ul>
          <ul>- The right of Countries to protect themselves from too low priced agricultural and food imports and production costs</ul>
          <ul>- The populations taking part in the agricultural policy choices.</ul>
          <ul>- The recognition of women farmers’ rights, who play a major role in agricultural production and in food.</ul>
        <p>Gaining sovereignty over food consumption, production, and trade is vital toward establishing true sovereignty. It has been found that the establishment of sovereignty over these systems can act as an antidote for the colonization and oppression of these peoples, through reconnection with the land and to their cultures.</p>

              <h3>Introduction</h3> 
        <hr>
              <p>The tribes of O’odham are the indigenous tribes that reside today around the Mexico-American border; however, it wasn't always this way. The land that the Tohono O’odham tribe had a claim on for a millennia was effectively split following the Gadsden purchase after the Mexican-American war <a href= "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17442222.2023.2270885">(DeAlba 2023)</a>. Citizens of both the United States and Mexico have taken advantage of the lack of protection for the people on the border, with some farmers encroaching on reservation land by putting fences up with the intention of taking extra acres of land and keeping indigenous people out. Yet, with this specific plot of land given to the O’odham tribes in-between two countries, it comes to no one's surprise that issues arise when it comes to these tribes traveling in their own land. </p>
	<p>Nation-state governments in both America and Mexico have been at conflict with indigenous peoples when it comes to disputing jurisdiction over ancestral territories. Furthermore, these people have held traditional religious migrations over these ancestral territories, yet these conflicts still persist. With this in mind, indigenous people have used the border to gain attention in order for their tribes to make their case and get federal recognition <a href= "https://www.proquest.com/docview/276339970?parentSessionId=Fr12JJan063uOohtAkSNITCIaDoKyu2thCHnVLXlegQ%3D&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses">(Booth 2000).</a></p>

         <h3>Violation of Indigenous Rights</h3>

              </figure>
            <p style="text-align: left; padding-right: 20px;">Border crossing has been a point of contention between Tohono O’odham Nation, the United States, and Mexico, and continues to be an issue today. Because the Tohono O’odham Nation has lands that span over the Mexican-American border, they are forced to present identification documents at the points of crossing and are not able to freely move within their own lands. This raises the question of which kind of identification can be used and how? United States citizens present U.S. Passports or Enhanced State Driver’s License when crossing the border by land, but Tohono O’odham people are not U.S. citizens as they are a sovereign nation. The Enhanced Tribal Identification Cards (ETCs) were a solution created with the US government for sovereign nations within the United States like the Tohono O’odham Nation to cross into their Mexican Lands and return to the United States. This is a modern solution to a modern problem regarding border crossing, that the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua reserved the rights for Indigenous Nations who were separated from their lands and people by  new borders caused by the American war for Independence.  This treaty has been violated innumerable times since its inception, creating problems such as these for the Tohono O’odham Nation. <a href= "https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/EMRIP/Call/IndigenousAllianceWithoutBorders.pdf">(Leza, 2024)</a></p>
            <p style="text-align: left; padding-right: 20px;">The Tohono O’odham are unable to travel freely across the border. They should be allowed as they were given the ability in the past with the existence of gates that they are able to pass through. International rights exist for indigenous communities, for example with the UNDRI, which grants them the ability to travel across borders to cultural lands and natural resources. The Jay Treaty of 1794 is a treaty that exists to allow travel across the US-Canadian border. <a href="https://theconversation.com/for-native-americans-us-mexico-border-is-an-imaginary-line-111043">(Leza, 2019)</a>. </p>

          <h3>Religious Freedoms & Physical Separation from Sacred Objects & Locations</h3>

          </figure>
          <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px;">Travel to religious sites is a protected right for tribes located along the border with the creation of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. This is heavily restricted with the further cementation of the border alongside strict regulation on identification laws along the border. The US government is given the ability to waive any US law to enforce the use of identification since 2005 with the Real ID Act <a href= "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade9557">(Scheidel, 2023)</a>. For example, the practice of collecting sweet grass, bird feathers, and pine leaves are core to the religious practices of the Tohono O’odham Nation. The government has gone as far as fencing off large areas of their lands including a traditionally sacred pass through the desert to the southern territories they possess. This is a huge infringement on the religious freedoms of the Tohono O’odham Nation. The tribe has taken to cutting the wire fences themselves to access their lands, as their proposed solutions such as the “Tohono O’odham Citizenship Act of 2013” was proposed and failed to pass in Congress. Many prominent members of the nation have come out and have stated they would protest the development of a border wall as those at Standing Rock defended their land and Vice Chairperson Verlon Jose has asserted that it will be built “over [his] dead body”. <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1169&context=ailj">(Kowalski, 2017)</a> </p>

          <p style="text-align: right; padding-left: 20px;"> The Tohono O’odham have strong traditions as farmers and hunter-gathers all across their territories since time immemorial. This has strong importance to the Nation as they rely on the saguaro fruit and other things they grow and gather for both economic and ceremonial endeavors. The territory was divided due to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as well as the Gadsden Purchase of 1853. In Mexico, the tribe has been robbed of their traditional lands used for mestizo ranches and farms, their lands were sold off to Anglo-immigrants very similar to the United States Allotment Act. <a href="https://trw.sdsu.edu/English/Projects/Docs/tribes.pdf">(Peterson, J. A., Wilken-Roberston, M.)</a>

          <h3>United States vs Mexican Perspective of the Tribe</h3>
          <hr>
            <p>The border acts as a display of the imbalance of power existing between the countries of US and Mexico, with one being a well-developed country and the other being an underdeveloped one in comparison. The tribes associated with the conflict of the border, most notably the Tohono O’odham, are most susceptible to the impact on the human condition which feeds into the imbalance of power. The US has the most say in what will happen to the tribe. Even if the Tohono O'odham fate was in Mexico’s hands, it would face issue with tribes not being viewed as sovereign states within the country and are thus susceptible to the regulations of the state. <a href= "https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.24.1.447">(Alvarez, 1995).</a> </p>
            <p>The O’odham communities frequently traveled between the US state of Arizona to the Mexican state of Sonora in order to visit loved ones and to perform religious rituals as well as ceremonies. These events have been taking place for ages, yet neither federal nor state governments of both the United States or Mexico have made it simple for these tribes to follow their traditions. The oral history passed down for generations push the O’odham to continue such traditions despite further difficulties due to the harsher border control policies of today.</p>
            <p> Itzkuauhtli Zamora, a member of the Tohono O'odham community residing in Mexico states,"We call her Mother Earth because from her came the water, the fruit; we came from her and we will return to her in the end… the earth is left alone, without the O’odham… [Pozo Verde] has been abandoned, even with it being a sacred site. And there are other communities and sacred sites just like it that we can not take care of.”<a href= "https://www..researchgate.net/publication/270894141_Cosmovision_y_cultura_Tradiciones_miticas_de_los_o’odham_su_relacion_con_el_entorno_natural_y_la_vida_social">(Amador Bech 2011).</a></p>

          <h3>Enviormental Development</h3>

             </figure>
              <p>Developmental projects exist in a multitude of ways, such as roads, mines, walls, and factories. Projects are done to provide aid for the community they are being built in. The result of most developmental projects, however, is the opposite of what would be counted as helping. The Tohono O’odham has a history of a major developmental project pushed by the US government with the wall’s construction. This wall has existed in many forms since the early 20th century, with the first instance of its creation being a barbed wire fence in 1909 only covering a small area. The wall is currently being built under the Biden administration with the precedent set by the Trump administration and is resulting in many environmental issues. The most notable being plant and animal endangerment and the division of tribal lands.</p> 
              <p>Developmental projects exist around the world as well, such as the lead and lignite mines in Thailand. Both have resulted in the destruction of native lands with pollution and habitat destruction. The Thailand mines are an example of how developmental projects are designed to benefit the organization and government. Additionally, the border conflict showcases another fact that comes with developmental projects. That being they are not done with the acknowledgement of the people they will impact. The Tohono O’odham tribe will be divided due to the wall, as the US and Mexico did not factor in the existence of people on the border. (Forsyth, 2004)</p>
              <p>According to the BBC, the Tohono O'odham Nation was never consulted on the destruction of burial sites in effort to make way for the construction of the Oregon Pipeline in Arizona. This disrespect shown to the Tohono O’odham by the US government is justified by laws instilling that US National Security law supersedes pre-existing treaties with tribes to respect their sovereignty over their own lands. It allows the US government a “Trump” card to utilize any land north of the border for any purpose if they can justify the development’s utility as a security measure. <a href= "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51449739">(BBC, Feb 2020)</a> </p>

          <h3>Opposition to the Border Wall and Future Outlook</h3>

              <img src="http://www.tonation-nsn.gov/wp-content/gallery/nowall/Rafael-Castillo-Tucson-Sector-Tribal-Liaison-US-Customs-Border-Patrol.JPG"width="100%">

              </figure>
            <p style="text-align: left; padding-right: 20px;"> Many of the tribes whose traditional lands are near Mexican-American border were displaced by their colonial power to another area, but the Tohono O’odham was one of the only tribes who were not displaced, but instead divided by the 1848 territory redrawing between the United States and Mexico <a href = ""></a>(Dunbar-Ortiz, Pg 126.)</a> This creates an interesting relationship with the border and the nation that is unique to their fellow tribes, as many of them are not facing the same type of issues that the Tohono O’odham experience. </p>
              <p>The Tohono O’odham nation’s website has the many press releases and statements they have released throughout the years, including data and information that contests the common misconceptions that encourage the development of a border wall. They have many concerts, from the natural environment being destroyed, to the limited access to sacred lands. The tribal leaders have stated that there will never be a border wall on Tohono O’odham land going so far as to pass “over 20 resolutions opposing the construction of a border wall” at their legislative council in 2017, <a href="http://www.tonation-nsn.gov/nowall/">(Tohono O’odham Website.)</a> Their efforts continue as current political tension rises again in favor of the development of a wall, and even though a border divides the Tohono O’odham Nation hopefully a wall never will. </p>

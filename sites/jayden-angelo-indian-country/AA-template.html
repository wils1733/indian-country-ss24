          <p>The United States-Mexico border region has long been a subject filled with differing opinions, conflicts, land battles and a fusion of identities that can cause some people to not feel like they belong on either side of it. For the indigenous peoples of the region, especially the Lipan Apache or “Light Gray People” (the people this particular project will focus on), the land has always been theirs alongside other indigenous tribes, and now there’s a battle for recognition and acknowledgement in two entirely different countries coupled with the already horrendous acts faced over time. The Lipan Apache are a product of displacement from Northern Mexico, as are many other groups of indigenous people. In the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, what was left of the Lipan Apache were displaced at the hands of not only Americans, but Mexicans as well, into groups alongside the Mescalero and the Chiricahua to form the Mescalero Apache Tribe. The battle for the acknowledgement of the Lipan Apache has been long and strenuous as neither country has budged regarding the acknowledgement.

          <h3>Acknowledgment (or lack thereof):
          <p>While the Lipan Apache are often recognized by universities, and even cities, they’re still not federally recognized and little information is available as to why that is. The Lipan apache as a whole are low in numbers as far as tribal registration goes (4,500 according to their website). Joining the Mescalero at the hands of the military caused the Lipan to dwindle and become a part of one larger group in terms of recognition and federal documents to this point. The state of Texas has acknowledged the Lipan Apache on multiple occasions and with that, that’s the closest the Lipan have been to receiving any type of recognition from the government. According to one source, the Lipan Apache have an application in process with the United States with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as work within Mexico to gain recognition as well, but documentation for either of those claims is very hard to find, and likely hidden in government documents yet to be seen. The reasoning as to why recognition is still a big search for the Lipan Apache remains unclear, in documents, often very little information is available about the Lipan, as they tend to appear in documents about other tribes

	          <h3>Mexico’s role in the Lipan Apache’s journey.
</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Mexico is almost a non-existent factor when it comes to the Lipan Apache in the modern day. At the tribe’s core, Mexico is the beginning. Mexico is where the tribe was prior to the migration north into what became Texas. Despite the earlier source, not much, if anything is to be found about the subject of recognition and the Lipan Apache in Mexico. The border has acted as so much more than just a dividing line between countries, it has essentially cut off an entire group of people and changed cultures. Based on research relayed by Science.org (within works cited), in a study done from 1998-2004, it was found that 66% of Mexicans in the research project had indigenous ancestry in their DNA. Obviously, the study could only have grown to show more by this point in time, and with that, not all of the people, frankly not even the majority would be considered Lipan. The thing is, within this research, something comes to the light. The Mexican government does acknowledge indigenous people and their history, but not as much as the United States in comparison, based on surface-level research. It appears that being Mexican can overrule the idea of talking about indigenous past and DNA in many instances. This involves a lot of speculation, but it most importantly brings to light the thought that culture got lost within the border region during the times that displacement occurred. Those that remained in Mexico are simply just Mexican, and numbers in Mexico are even unknown because of that. But also, we see that the Lipan Apache, while not federally recognized, are recognized by the state of Texas and many universities, among other things. Mexico plays a huge role with their lack of information and recognition because it shows that despite their being a chance the ancestry of the Lipan are around, generationally, it may be lost over time if there isn’t more of a priority on indigenous history.

        <h3>The Border and its role
</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>The United States-Mexico border plays a large role in the entire lack of recognition between two countries because it’s become such a large topic of interest for other reasons, that it’s almost been forgotten about in the sense of how much history is destroyed, culturally speaking. It’s worth noting that many tribes have formed a Border Alliance and it could be worth monitoring whether the Lipan become involved and maybe a resolution in each country could be made.
